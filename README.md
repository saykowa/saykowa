### üò∏ Me

I'm a very multifaceted person. **My main specialization is development**. However, apart from that I've done a bunch of different things: design, video editing, system administration and many etc.

The first thing I learned was JS in conjunction with Node.JS since I was primarily interested in desktop development. So, this got me interested in code typing and markup, multithreading and working with WindowsAPI. That's how I moved to C# and .NET applications

Basically my projects provided handy parsers or bots. I created various APIs, requests-based or web scraping parsers
